# üí´ About Me:
Hello! I‚Äôm Logan, an enthusiastic data science student at MSU. I‚Äôve been an analytical thinker ever since I was young, starting a social media business at the age of 14 which I grew to 350,000 followers by leveraging video metrics to curate optimally viral short-form content on Instagram. After discovering a passion for coding and working with data my freshman year at MSU, I‚Äôve spent this past summer of 2024 self-learning advanced data science through online courses and studying for certifications.

I‚Äôm currently looking for internships related to data science this coming summer of 2025. Here are a few of my most relevant skills: I help teach Python at MSU as a ULA, I‚Äôm certified in Tableau for data visualization and dashboard creation, and I regularly practice database management in SQL. I‚Äôm eager to apply these skills I‚Äôve learned to deliver meaningful impact to real-world companies. Feel free to reach out to me through LinkedIn or email.<br>
